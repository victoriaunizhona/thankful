        message: 'Numerous studies have examined the relationship between gratitude and physical health markers such as cardiovascular health, stress and inflammation, pain perception, and sleep. One study found that keeping a gratitude journal improved diastolic blood pressure. Another study found that focusing on things to be grateful about before bed each night increased pre-sleep calmness. Yet another study found that people who kept a gratitude journal for 14 days reported fewer headaches, clearer skin, less stomach pain, and reduced congestion.',

        title: 'Gratitude increases sexual satisfaction in long-term romantic relationships',
        message: 'To arrive at this result, the researchers recruited 118 couples to participate in a multi-month study. Participants were asked to report the level of gratitude they expressed and received over a 3-week period. They were also asked to report their degree of sexual satisfaction. The researchers then re-contacted people three months later and asked them to complete the same measures. They found that changes in gratitude were closely associated with changes in sexual satisfaction. In other words, people were sexually satisfied to the extent that they expressed and received a high degree of gratitude.',
